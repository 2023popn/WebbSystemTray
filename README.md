# WebbSystemTray

A program which creates a system tray menu with options to display my school's weekly lunch menu and the daily schedule. The .app file also is set to not appear on the dock when opened. To have the app open on startup go to System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Login Items, then press the + button and select the .app file.
